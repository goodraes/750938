　　这个班是我中途接的，可是也已近两个月了，我居然没发现班上有这样的一个女孩，更不知道她叫什么名字，我心中的愧疚和自责化为丝丝缕缕的疼痛顷刻淹没了我，我似乎觉得那个女孩的微笑就像秋天的阳光，温暖中总有几分让我难以察觉的冷漠。我的眼前又浮现出一张男生的脸.。
　　　　――向作为企业家的黄怒波和作为诗人的骆英先生致敬　　　　　　　　　　　　　董桄福　　无庸置疑，中国诗歌是有过去的，而且是一个辉煌的过去。这个结论不需要像法官审案一样拿厚厚的唐诗宋词取证，只要简单的翻开基几本教科书已经可以定论了。　　至于现在嘛，依我看，中国诗人和诗歌都有些落寞。除了在网络上还有一些诗歌论坛，一些诗人在继续坚守，大部分人早已经将诗歌置之度外，不再当作一回事了！　　惊奇的是，前几天刚知道黄怒波因为担心“口无遮拦，迟早说过头”的原因关闭了新浪上的博客，本来以为这是一个隐退的告别仪式。谁知道今天爆出的新闻着实吓我一跳。中国作家网头条新闻赫然写着：　　《中坤集团回报社会：向中国诗歌界捐赠人民币3000万元》　　“元月21日上午，中国诗歌界近百名诗人、诗歌评论家、研究者齐聚北大，参加中坤诗歌发展基金捐赠仪式暨诗歌界迎春会。会上，北京中坤投资集团董事长黄怒波先生宣布，中坤集团向诗歌界捐赠人民币3000万元，用以促进中国诗歌事业的发展。为此，中坤集团设立了中坤诗歌发展基金，在3000万元的捐赠金额中，划出1000万元捐赠北京大学中文系新诗研究所，另外，划出1000万元损赠中国诗歌学会，其余1000万元由中坤诗歌发展基金管委会直接用于开展诗歌的交流及评奖等活动。”　　对一直热爱诗歌的我来说，这是一个极端意外的消息，一个企业家拿出如此巨额的资金支持诗歌，这到底是企业家的良心苏醒呢，还是诗歌将要借尸还魂，逐渐复活的征兆？一时间也开始“莫名的惊诧”。虽然说昨天买书还买了几本诗歌集子，自己正在整理即将于年内出版的文集里也有几卷是诗歌，但是的确没有想到过，区区一个文学体裁，一个纯粹私人化的兴趣爱好会一下子与3000万发生关系。再说了，这是一个诗歌全面沉默的时期，大家都纷纷将焦点转移到赚钱上，诗歌这种不会产生效益的分行排列的文字再怎样也无法带来巨额利润，怎么可以期望有什么奇迹发生？　　但是居然发生了！　　于是查询黄怒波，搜索结果，一下子知道了这件事情背后的文化意义。　　原来黄怒波本身就是一个诗人：中坤集团董事长黄怒波先生，笔名骆英，出版的诗集有《不要再爱我》、《拒绝忧郁》及近年的《落英集》、《都市流浪集》等，并出版中篇小说《蓝太阳》等。其中《落英集》和《都市流浪集》。2005年，中央文明办、中央外宣办、文化部等13家单位组成的“我们的文明”组委会还主办了骆英诗歌校园行系列活动，在北京、广州、深圳等地的十几所高校举办了骆英诗歌作品朗诵会，高校学子们反响热烈。由于骆英热爱诗歌创作和对诗歌界作出的公益性贡献，中国诗歌学会在会上宣布骆英为“006年中国诗歌万里行”形象大使。　　可以理解的理由找到了，大约十年前，中国诗歌还比较兴旺，诗坛还非常繁荣的时候，我在一本诗集的扉页上就曾经写下一句话：最好的诗歌也丝毫不能改变人类的境遇，但诗多少可以让人类心灵获得安宁！”　　看来只有这个理由。　　但是这个理由已经够了。　　黄怒波以一个企业家的身份获得了财富，但是当他在公众面前承认是一个诗人的时候却遭到讥笑和误解。无奈只好换一个名字，用骆英的笔名写诗，继续保存并不断清洗内心的灰尘，这段经历也许可以佐证我的那个简单论断吧！　　身边的人群现在正忙于蝇营狗苟，基本没有时间将心灵的成长和充实当一回事，诗歌自然就衰落了。我甚至还在博客上看到某位先生对唐朝大诗人李白定义说“不过是一个吹牛大王而已！”我们的文化已经全部跌进了实用主义的泥沼，所谓文学，艺术，诗歌……都是些没用的东西，自然不会被重视。大家宁可追星，宁可对所谓名流，名家，明星的一句咳嗽热情鼓掌，激动得想要跳楼，也不会对这些不会产生绩效的东西报以微笑了。　　博客上的一场点击率恶战已经明显的彰显出社会公众的主体文化心态。　　一千个诗人作家的点击率之和也无法与一个影视明星抗衡，一万个草根博客废寝忘食的努力也不能与一个三流歌手的一声粗俗的问好较真……这就是我们这个时代的价值取向。就其深层原因，无论是影视明星还是三流歌手，只要出招就意味着赚钱、利润，当然不会有人来支持只能哼哼，浪费纸张和墨水，无法创造即刻效益的文学，尤其是诗歌，这当然就会冷落了诗人！　　那么黄怒波的行为意味着什么呢！　　不是发自真心，就是疯了，要么是超级做秀？　　幸好，我们看到，黄怒波先生是一个诗人，出版过诗歌集子的诗人，一直在低调，无奈地与现世文化对抗的诗人！　　作为诗人的黄怒波在接受采访时说过：诗对我来说从来不是展露才华，从来都是寄托，为什么？很多人从来不知道我写诗，认识我十几年，不知道我写诗，因为我那时候叫黄怒波，要发表诗歌叫骆英，很多人不知道我骆英是我，所以有很多网站我也不知道收了我好多诗，最近因为是骆英突然红起来，大家说骆英是你啊，但是对我来说我不张扬在哪儿，这样我觉得这诗是我的精神，是一种生存方式，我也没想到去到处宣扬做一个很知名的诗人。　　从这个意义上说，黄怒波是在将3000万元捐给一个寄托，捐给一个未来。　　　　　我渺小，和八面来风抗争　　　　　我自尊，在自己的轨道上运行　　这是他的诗集《落英集》里面的一个句子，正好印证了诗人内心的状态。　　　　　无法面对尘世的辉煌　　　　　没有寻觅我惶恐悲痛　　这是另一个句子，正是一个企业家外表掩映下的诗人内心的挣扎。他看到的是：　　　　　人和人　　　　　总隔得太远　　　　　心和心　　　　　总难以相连　　　　　所有的语言都残缺不全……　　于是，还是愿意为内心，为精神建设一个世界，除了用大多数诗人会用的方式――写诗，更用了大多数诗人无能力运用，大多数企业家绝对不会运用的方式：捐出3000万，来建设内心的美好世界。至于部分人不理解，还会有人唾骂，那又怎样呢？　　　　　要遗弃你就遗弃吧　　　　　我的孤独更加高贵　　　　　要背叛你就背叛吧　　　　　我的忠贞更加完美　　　　　忧伤的长夜　一次次蜕荡　　　　　我就从班驳的生命中新生！　　我个人并不认为3000万可以让中国诗人脱困，也不会让中国诗歌勃起，连捐出3000万的黄怒波自己都懒得继续“博”了，这正好可以举证，要让一个巨大群体的灵魂复苏和心灵觉醒并非易事。但是，用3000万倡导一种开始，用3000万衡量一个诗人，一首诗歌，一个文学体裁的价值，多少也做了一道并非绝对准确的算术题。　　这个事件给企业家的启示要是能够大于给诗人的启示就太好了。　　当然，这种结局是不可奢求的，最终可能还是诗人领悟到一些内在的意义。因为，只有诗人，只有内心有诗的人，一直保持着精神领地的人知道：　　　　　在落英的季节开始漂泊　　　　　这经历过苦难的生命无法诉说　　　　　落英啊，你应该在盛开时坠落　　　　　由残破的风翻弄　　　　　吹散远方　　　　　吹散大漠　　只有这些人知道让精神的马永远奔跑在生命的路上，没有终点！　　从这个意义上说，我们愿意向作为企业家的黄怒波先生致敬，向他对自己的心灵的这样一个投资致敬，更向作为诗人的骆英先生致敬，因为他的行为告诉我们两个字，叫做：　　坚守！　　只要坚守，并且不放弃行走，总会有未来……　　　　　　　　　　　　　2006年1月21日星期

This class is what I answered, but also has nearly two months, I didn't find such a girl in the class, more do not know what's her name, the guilt and remorse to while the pain in my heart suddenly flooded me, I seem to feel the girl's smile is like the autumn sunshine, let me warm, there is always somewhat difficult to detect indifference.
My eyes and see a boy's face..
- to Mr Huang as an entrepreneur and as a poet LuoYing salute Mr Dong Guang f there is no doubt that Chinese poetry is the past, and it is a glorious past.
This conclusion does not need to like it with a thick tang poetry forensics, as long as simple a few textbooks that can have already opened.
For now, in my opinion, the Chinese poets and poems are lonely.
In addition to some poetry BBS on the Internet, some poets in continue to stick to, most people will already poetry out, no longer seriously!
Surprise, just know a few days ago Mr Huang for fear sooner or later ", said "the cause of the closed sina blog, thought it was a retirement farewell ceremony.
Who know today broke the news really frighten me to jump.
Chinese writer WangTou news impressively write: ", the zhongkun group, social returns: at alls donated 30 million yuan to China "" on the morning of January 21, China at alls hundreds of poet, poetry critic, the researchers gathered in Peking University, attending ZhongKun poetry development fund donation ceremony and at alls YingChunHui.
ZhongKun investment group chairman at the meeting, Beijing announced that Mr Mr Huang at alls, the zhongkun group, to donate 30 million yuan, to promote the development of Chinese poetry.
So, the zhongkun group, set up ZhongKun poetry development fund, in the donation amount of 30 million yuan, to draw 10 million yuan donation of Peking University, institute of new poetry, on the other hand, to draw 10 million yuan donated the Chinese poetry society, the remaining 10 million yuan by ZhongKun poetry development fund management committee directly to swap of poetry and awards."
For I have always loved poetry, it is an extreme accident, an entrepreneur out of such a huge sums of money to support poetry, the entrepreneur's awakening conscience is it, or poetry will rebirthing, gradually the signs of resurrection?
At that time also started to "express surprise".
Although said yesterday to buy book also bought some poetry collection, they are finishing are being published this year also has a few rolls in the corpus is a poem, but did not think of, just a literary genre, a purely personal interests will suddenly with 30 million.
Said again, this is a silent period poetry, everybody will focus on making money and poetry that does not produce benefits branch to arrange words again how to also cannot bring huge profits, how can you expect a miracle?
But actually happened!
So the query Mr Huang, search results, suddenly see the cultural meaning behind it.
Mr Huang is in itself a poet: original, the zhongkun group, Mr Chairman Mr Huang, pen name LuoYing, published poems have "don't love me", "refused to depression, and in recent years, the tree lost its set, the urban homeless sets, etc., and published medium-length novel" blue sun "and so on.
The tree lost its sets and the urban homeless sets.
In 2005, the central government, the central propaganda bureaus and foreign affairs offices, the ministry of culture of 13 units such as "our civilization" the organizing committee also hosted LuoYing poetry campus line series activity, in Beijing, guangzhou, shenzhen and other places of more than a dozen colleges and universities held LuoYing poetry slams, college students responded enthusiastically.
Because LuoYing love poetry creation and contribution to public welfare made at alls, announced at the meeting of Chinese poetry society LuoYing for "006 China wan lixing" the poetry image ambassador.
Understandable reason found, about a decade ago, Chinese poetry is relatively prosperous, poetry was very prosperous, I once wrote in a book of poems on the cover page of a word: the best poetry also can not change the human situation, but how many can let the human mind poems have peace!"
It seems only this reason.
But this reason is enough.
Mr Huang acquired wealth as an entrepreneur, but when he admitted in public is a poet when it was ridiculed and misunderstanding.
But had to change a name, use LuoYing pen name write poetry, continue to save and clean the dust in the inner, the experience may be able to support my judgment on that simple!
People around you are busy now concentrate on making profits, basic didn't have time to spiritual growth and enrich seriously, poetry natural decline.
I even see one gentleman on the blog of the tang dynasty poet li bai definition said "but is a fast talker!"
Our culture has all fell into the mire of pragmatism, the so-called literature, art, poetry...
Is all some useless things, nature will not be regarded.
We would rather make track for a star, rather than to a celebrity, famous artists, star of a cough enthusiastic applause, excited and want to jump off a building, nor to the performance of these does not produce things smile.
Blog a hit battle has obvious highlights the main body of the social public cultural mentality.
One thousand poets click-through rates cannot compete with a movie star, the sum of ten thousand grassroots blog excises efforts also can't with a third-rate singer a serious sound rude to say hello...
This is the value orientation of our times.
With respect to its deep reasons, whether it is a movie star or a third-rate singer, as long as something means to make money, profit, of course no one to support only hum, waste paper and ink, cannot create immediate benefit of literature, poetry, in particular, this is, of course, will snub a poet!
So what does it mean to Mr Huang's behavior!
Is not a true heart, or mad, or is super show?
Mr. Luckily, we see that Mr Huang was a poet, published poetry collection of poet, has been low-key, helplessly against the secular culture poet!
As a poet, Mr Huang said in an interview that the poem for me is never show talent, has always been, and why?
Many people never know I write poetry, know more than ten years, I don't know I write poetry, because at that time I call Mr Huang, to call LuoYing published poetry, many people don't know I LuoYing is me, so I don't know there are a lot of website I received a lot of poetry, because recently was LuoYing suddenly red, everybody said LuoYing is you, but for me where I do not make public, so I think this poem is my spirit, is a way of life, I also have never thought to preach everywhere to be a very famous poet.
In this sense, Mr Huang is in 30 million yuan will be donated to a place, to a future.
I'm small, and struggling neighborhoods my self-esteem, in its own orbit which is his poetry anthology "tree lost its set inside a sentence, mirrored the poet's inner state.
Cannot face the worldly glory not alone for I fear this is another sentence, it is shaded by an entrepreneur looks poet inner struggle.
He saw that people always separated too far heart and heart always connected to all language is incomplete...
So, still willing to pay for the heart, one of the world to the spirit building, in addition to use most poets will use way, write poetry, more with most poets have no ability to use, most entrepreneurs would never use way: 30 million donation, to build a better world.
As for some people don't understand, also can some people reviled, so what?
Want to abandon you, abandon my loneliness is more noble to betray you will betray me faithful more perfect process swinging again and again when I was a night of sorrow from mottled in the new life!
I personally don't believe that 30 million can let Chinese poet, also won't let Chinese poetry erection, even donated 30 million Mr Huang himself didn't continue to "Po", it would be proof, let the soul of a large group recovery and spiritual awakening is not easy.
But, in 30 million to advocate a beginning, in 30 million to measure a poet, a poem, the value of a literary genre, how many also made a not absolutely accurate arithmetic.
If this event is for entrepreneurs to enlightenment to greater than the revelation of the poet's great.
Of course, this result is not to expect, may eventually understand the meaning of some internal or poet.
Because the only poet, only inner people with poetry, has maintained the spirit domain of people know: at the start of the season tree lost its drift that has experienced the tree lost its life be able to speak of suffering, when you should be in full bloom falling by broken blow blow the wind turned the distance of the desert only these people know let spirit Ma Yongyuan run in the way of life, there is no end!
In this sense, we are willing to salute as entrepreneur Mr Mr Huang, to such an investment in your heart, more to salute Mr LuoYing as a poet, because his actions tell us two words, called: stick to!
As long as the stick to, and do not give up, there will always be the future...
